Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = .0011
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 1.2E-5
454836818 states generated, 49802844 distinct states found, 143300000 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 66.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 30 and the 95th percentile is 5).
